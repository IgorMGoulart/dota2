Games have always been a passion of mine, and when I saw the database of 500.000 matches of Dota 2 I decided to do some analysis in the results, and now Iâ€™ll be sharing my findings it with you.

First of all, Dota 2 is a multiplayer online game where 10 players are divided into 2 teams of 5: Dire and Radiant. Each player selects a hero to play. During the match, there are several important factors that can help you win the game, including kills, assists, gold, damage and game time.

In this analysis, the initial focus will be on assessing whether the side team (Dire or Radiant) that you are on influences your chances of winning. Subsequently, we will dive into hero-specific win rate and the influence of the game time in this rate, followed by more game results to identify the most successful heroes.
